## Campaign Analysis of Launch Dates and Funding Goals
### Overview
The Kickstarter data analyzed is composed of over 4000 crowdfunding camapaigns that took place from October 2010 to March 2017.

This analysis focused on how these theater crowdfunding campaigns performed with respect to the launch dates and funding goals.

We also filtered our Parent Category to only reflect data for "theater". After the pivot table was created we then created a line chart to reflect this specific information. You will see
