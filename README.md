# Kickstarter Analysis 
## Campaign Analysis of Launch Dates and Funding Goals
### Overview
The Kickstarter data analyzed is composed of over 4000 crowdfunding camapaigns that took place from October 2010 to March 2017. These campaigns were across multiple countries with a multitude of different categories. The objective of this analysis is to assist a new playwrite in researching crowdfunding campaigns to gain insight for launching her own future campaign(s). Our focus was on theater and specifically "plays".  We examined the launch dates and funding goals and compared them to the outcomes - "successful, failed and canceled". This analysis focused on how these theater crowdfunding campaigns performed with respect to the launch dates and funding goals. 

### Analysis
#### Launch Dates
The first focus of this analysis was on the launch dates of theatatrical plays.  We filtered the parent category and years out of the kickstarter data and created a pivot table. In the pivot table we arranged our years to reflect each month and only focused on the outcomes - "successful, failed and canceled".  We eliminated the "live" outcome.  We also filtered our Parent Category to only reflect data for "theater". After the pivot table was created we then created a line chart to reflect this specific information. You will see the dramatic peak in the months of May and June that show they are the most successful months for launching a theater crowdfunding campaign. You will also see that the months of January, March and September were the least successful months.  The end of the year starting with October and going through December shows a steady decrease in succesful campaigns.  The amount of failed campaigns stayed in the 20 to 55 range for each month of the year.
